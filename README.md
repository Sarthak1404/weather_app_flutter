# Weather App

## Introduction
This file documents the development of a weather application using Flutter. The app provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, and additional meteorological information for locations worldwide.

## Objective
To create a user-friendly weather application that delivers accurate and timely weather data, with a focus on performance and scalability.

## Methodology
The project followed an agile development process, with iterative cycles consisting of planning, development, testing, and review.

### UI/UX Design
The UI was designed to be intuitive and engaging, with a clean layout that presents weather data without clutter. The design includes:
- Current temperature and weather conditions
- Hourly forecast with weather icons
- Weekly forecast with high/low temperatures
- Wind speed indicators
- Sunrise and sunset times
- AQI and more information

### API Integration
The app utilizes the Weather API to fetch weather data. 

### Performance Optimization
Flutter's performance profiling tools were used to optimize the app's performance, ensuring smooth animations and quick loading times even on older devices.

## Results
The app successfully provides users with:
- Real-time weather updates
- Hourly and weekly forecasts
- Alert for severe weather.

## Conclusion
The Weather App stands as a testament to the capabilities of Flutter in creating high-performance, visually appealing applications. It serves as a reliable tool for users to plan their day around the weather.

## Future Scope
- Integration with more data sources for improved accuracy
- A robust error handling mechanism ensures the app remains functional even if the API is down.
- Expansion of the notification system for personalized alerts
- Implementation of machine learning to predict weather patterns

## Installation
